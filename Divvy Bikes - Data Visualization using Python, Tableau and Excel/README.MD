# Data Visualization of Divvy Bikes 

The projects in this repo are created as part of the course "**Data Visualization**" with **Kevin Hartman** through **ELVTR**.
I've used the data from a real company -- **Divvy** -- to guide through the various stages of a project that ends in the production of client-ready dataviz. 
The projects are created posing as the Lead Analyst on a team that Lindsay Silk-Kremenak, Divvyâ€™s Director of Marketing, selected to help Divvy improve its business using data.

I try to explore some of the questions like 
- how Divvy could convert Casual Riders into full Members?
- Which are has more riders for Divvy?
- What is the re-balancing issue and what are the potential reasons?
- Can re-balancing be avoided to improve Divvy business? 
- and many more..

2. Finding Stories through EDA 
3. Conducting Advanced EDA
4. Conducting Advanced Data Analysis 
5. Creating Client Ready Data Visualization 
6. Presenting Information with Conviction
