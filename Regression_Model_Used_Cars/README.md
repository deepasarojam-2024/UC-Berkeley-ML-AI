# Practical Application 2 - Used Cars Price Prediction using Regression

## Background and Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to identify the major rationale affecting the resale value of used cars. The dataset is from Used Cars data from Craiglist and has 3M records. For this project, a subset of the project with 426K records was used in the analysis to determine whether there is a relationship between factors such as the model, manufacturer, condition, fuel type, transmission type, paint color, age of the car, etc., and car resale value. I.e, the project aims to provide recommendations to your client; a used car dealership as to what consumers value in a used car.
