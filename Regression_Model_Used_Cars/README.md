# Practical Application 2 - Used Cars Price Prediction using Regression

## Overview
In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

To frame the task, throughout these practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM Links to an external site..

## Data:
You will work with a used car dataset Links to an external site.for this assignment.

## Business Understanding

From a business perspective, we are asked to identify the factors that influence used car prices. In CRISP-DM terms, we are asked to convert this business problem into a data problem definition.
