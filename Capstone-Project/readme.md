Files Submitted for Review
The Capstone Project proposal proposal.pdf.
The Capstone Project Report capstone_project_report.pdf.
The implemented code, in the form of an ipython notebook Capstone Project.ipynb
The datasets used for the project can be located on the Kaggle Competition Page.
The highest scoring submission file is also included in the repository as submit_VGG16_run7.csv.
The best saved weights for VGG16 could not be included as the files size was ~270mb.
